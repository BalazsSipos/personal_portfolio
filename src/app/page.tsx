            <h1>2. Personal details</h1>
            <div>
              Some words of my past, what did I learn, what did I do, why did I
              change profession from financial analyst to software developer.
              Layout: Left: List of elements, right: one by one the element
              details. With scrolling we can go through all.
            </div>
            <p>
              1. Financial analyst: I have been working for more, than 10 years
              as a financial analyst a.k.a. controller. I was responsible for
              the financial planning, budgeting, forecasting, reporting, and
              analysis of different companies. I have learned a lot about the
              financial side of the businesses, but I felt that I need more
              creativity and more challenges. I wanted to create something new,
              something that can be seen and used by others. I wanted to affect
              other peoples life. I wanted to be a software developer.

            <h1>3. Hobbies</h1>
            <div>
              What I like, music, sport, way of living. Layout: One frame, small
              bubbles from left to right, with a click some small info appears
              in a slightly bigger space.
            </div>
            <p>
              1. Sport: I am close to be a real decathlete on Track and Field.
              This is a competition where you have to be good in 10 different
              athletic sports: several running, jumping and throwing events
              included, so it requires wide range of skills, just like a
              Fullstack Developer in software development.
            </p>

            <p>
              2. Wandering: I like to be in the nature, especially in the
              mountains and forests. My longest hikes are around 50 km in a day,
              but my favorite daily distance is around 15-20 km, which is long
              enough to be able to think a lot, but short enough not to be
              exhausted, so I can fully feel the nature and be part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Music: I like to listen metal music, especially metalcore. I
              like the energy, the power, it gives me.
